# Recipies-idea

Text mining on recipe websites to pull out food i'd like to eat, then also have a whats in my fridge list and only select recipies from db with food I have in my fridge.

Needs to allow for suitable alternatives like "butter" in recipe for "dairy free butter" for example - or maybe I make my fridge list really general?
Needs to allow alternatives in terms of making a chicken casserol instead for a beef caserole if you have chicken in the fridge and no beef
Would be nice to have the functionality to change number of people eating and therefore update recpie, to put in diety requireements and it changes the recipe.
Would be nice to use db of recipies top choose weeks food and then autogen shopping list, taking into account subsitutions for the most economical option. For example, say youre making a shepards pie and chili that week it makes the most sence to use beed mince in both regardless of the recpie as both can be used.
